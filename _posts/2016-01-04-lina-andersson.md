*Beth was lucky enough to go on a whirlwind recruiting trip to Edinburgh in November, where she met some fabulous Comp Sci students - you'll see their profiles over the next few months.*

*For this shoot she hung out with Lina Andersson  in Old College- the part that looks the most like Hogwarts. Unfortunately the CompSci kids don't actually do any classes in here - much to Lina's disappointment - but it was a great place to squeeze a shoot in between rain showers.*

### Tell us a little about you.

I'm a second year student at the University of Edinburgh, originally from Sweden and Finland but I grew up all over. I've lived in France since I was 12.

I study Computer Science, but I also take classes in Economics and Maths - I still haven't decided quite what I want to do yet. Right now, I want to get more involved with art and theatre, something I did when I was younger but that ended up kind of fading away when I got to university.

Five things I love are [Matt Corby](http://mattcorby.com.au/splash/telluric), Buffy the Vampire Slayer, sushi, the beach, and dogs.

### Tell us about what you're wearing.

In this outfit, I'm wearing a vintage [wool cape](http://amzn.to/1RdtM0X), a thrifted [silk blouse](http://amzn.to/1RdtwyV), and a [denim skirt](http://amzn.to/22I08o5) from Monki.

In my more colorful outfit I have a old [Petit Bateau raincoat](http://amzn.to/22I0dYW) (thrifted), a [navy sweatshirt](http://amzn.to/22I0hIm) (thrifted), the same silk button-down shirt (thrifted), [running tights](http://amzn.to/1RdugEu) (H&M), and shiny black [Doc Martens](http://amzn.to/22I0GKC). My backpack is from Jansport and I got the hoop earrings at Topshop.

### How did your style evolve to what it is now?

I got really into thrift shopping when I was little - I'd say around age 11. I've picked up some pretty interesting pieces over that time; my favorite is an old belt with gold Egyptian landmarks on it that doesn't close properly so I've never worn it.

I'm pretty into art, so I've always wanted to have a unique curated look. I've never managed that - all I really wear is a stained navy sweatshirt and jeans. I like the kind of clothes you can just throw on and go, very laidback and easygoing. My ideal look would be [Brooke Shields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooke_Shields) in [The Blue Lagoon](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080453/).

### Any advice for a young person thinking about getting into a STEM field?

{% responsive_image path: "images/posts/2015/12/IMG_6796-1024x683.jpg" %}

Before I came to university, I hadn't done any programming or really anything related to Computer Science. I based my decision on the fact that I really liked math and I really liked sci-fi, which in retrospect was not the best idea.

I found the first year rather intimidating, which was mainly because I didn't put in a lot of effort. Now that I'm more confident, I'm really excited about it, although my programming skills are still not great. I would advise anyone to try some programming beforehand but not to be nervous - it looks complicated from the outside but it's all very logical and everyone's here to help out.

Also don't base your degree choices on your favourite TV shows.

### What would you say is the project you've done that you're proudest of?

{% responsive_image path: "images/posts/2015/12/IMG_6731-1024x683.jpg" %}

I wouldn't really say there's any one thing I'm proudest of, but I'm pretty excited about lots of things!

I've recently moved into the Edinburgh Student Housing Co-Operative, which is a set of apartment buildings run by the students that live there. It's a very cool project and we're the largest co-op in the UK. I also volunteer at Food Sharing Edinburgh which is about reducing food waste.

I worked last summer at a nature reserve teachings kids about wildlife conservation, and I'd really like to do something next summer that would combine my experience with tech and economics with conservation work.

I think STEM fields have a massive impact on the world and it's really important to think about what the consequence of that impact is.

### Are there any misconceptions about STEM fields that you'd like to clear up?

{% responsive_image path: "images/posts/2015/12/IMG_6717-1024x683.jpg" %}

I've gotten a lot of weird reactions when I say I do Computer Science - sometimes even disbelief. One guy told me to switch course; he thought I'd do better in journalism or something like that. There's a lot of stigma around studying Computer Science, and the stereotype that it's very antisocial, geeky field is something that I was worried about when applying.

However, I've met so many super cool people, and I'm really happy I chose it. There's so much support, and University of Edinburgh has two great societies that I've made so many friends through - [CompSoc](https://comp-soc.com/compsoc/page/home) and especially [Hoppers](http://hoppers.inf.ed.ac.uk/).

### What is the best way (if any) for people to follow you on social media?

{% responsive_image path: "images/posts/2015/12/IMG_6737-1024x683.jpg" %}

I'm not super active on social media, but you can follow me on Instagram ([1996anders](http://instagram.com/1996anders)) or find me on [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/lina-andersson-02772410a)! I also have a [pretentious Tumblr](http://texas1996.tumblr.com).

*Picking her degree based off her favorite TV show seems to have served Lina alright so far - and Beth's definitely used similar decision making methods in the past!*

*All in all, meeting Lina was a blast. She's a great example of how diverse the University of Edinburgh is - everyone you meet is from somewhere interesting, but not from Edinburgh! Stay tuned for 4 more Edinburgh profiles.*

*Love,*

*Dona & Beth*
