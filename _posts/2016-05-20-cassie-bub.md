*We had the pleasure of meeting Cassie Bub when she was an intern and immediately we knew what we were going to make her do for her photos...I mean, let's be real, how often are you going to meet a computer scientist + musician + GYMNAST!  We managed to catch this feisty multi-hyphenate in a net and insisted she tell us all the things. *

### Tell us a little about you.

I am a rising junior at Texas A&M University majoring in Computer Science with Minors in Math and Neuroscience. I also spent last summer as an Explorer Intern at Microsoft working on Bing answers, and will be returning this summer. I fell in love with the uniqueness that is computer science in high school, and that feeling has only increased throughout my years in college. It continues to astound me just how complex and powerful computers are.

In my free time I play flute in the Wind Symphony at A&M, and have gotten some amazing opportunities to travel with them. Music is one of the few things that can reach out and transcend cultural differences so easily. We played in Ireland last summer! It's an awesome feeling playing a concert in another country and watching the crowd really get into what you're playing, despite the fact that you are of different nationalities.

Gymnastics is another big component in my life, as I have been involved in the sport since I was three. I stopped doing gymnastics right before high school, thinking I was done forever, but it kept calling out to me. In college I got back into it, and am now on the Texas A&M gymnastics team where I have met some of the loveliest people. It's unreal competing again, and while it's been tough, it is so worth it to do the sport that I love again.

### Tell us about what you're wearing.

I'm a little obsessed with lacy dresses and own way, way too many. This maroon [dress](http://amzn.to/27HhcNz) is one of my favorites as I love how it is so simple and light. The earrings with this outfit compliment the simplicity of the dress as they are quite ornate. I found these in a tiny shop in Ireland last summer and couldn't resist the lure of the gorgeous gold design with the tiny shining jewels.

Who doesn't like leggings?! They are incredibly comfy and can be dressed way up or way down. I paired the tight [leggings](http://amzn.to/255tPzF) with a flowing top which is a bright and fun shade of [teal](http://amzn.to/1YIpz5n). The earrings with this outfit are my go-to "fancy" earrings as they really catch light due to their smooth silver appearance.

The favorite thing about my closet though are my [black combat boots](http://amzn.to/27Hjigr). If you can't tell by their worn out appearance I wear them all the time. They are incredibly sturdy but stylish at the same time! I love them!

### How did your style evolve to what it is now?

In high school I was notorious for my lace cami under a plain v-neck top paired with jeans and Vans. I didn't feel comfortable branching out at all. I found something I was used to and stuck with it.

Since then I have worked to expand my closet and find clothes that I wasn't just comfortable in, but clothes that I loved and made me feel confident! I still like more of a classic, simple look, but it is a far cry from my days of basically the exact same outfit.

It's scary to put yourself out there, whether that's a new outfit or as simple as saying hi to someone new, but I believe that shouldn't hold you back. Stay true to what you want to wear!

### Any advice for a young person thinking about getting into a STEM field?

One of the cool things about the field as it is evolving now, is that is incredibly low-cost to you to get involved. There is still a learning curve to get started, but there are so many resources online that are free and make it easy to learn. If you really like something in the STEM field utilize these resources that people have created for you! There is so much information out there, and it's never to late to start!

I was intimidated by the people who said they had been coding for years and knew so many languages already, but I also know a lot of people who are just like me and didn't really know they wanted to get into the STEM field until college.

### What would you say is the project you've done that you're proudest of?

This past summer I worked on Bing answers and was able to incorporate my love for music into something really cool! [I created a guitar tuner](https://www.bing.com/search?q=guitar+tuner&go=Submit&qs=n&form=QBLH&pq=guitar+tuner&sc=8-11&sp=-1&sk=&ghc=1&cvid=ca04a98645654bdcb930d9e149559790), and so far it seems like people are really liking it!

### What is the best way (if any) for people to follow you on social media?

*We so appreciated Cassie being willingness to do a whimsical photoshoot with us with some of her best gymnastics tricks. We also love her badass time-management skills! "Balancing" (haha) the A&M gymnastics team and the symphony WHILE nailing a CS degree? That's skillz. *

*Thank you Cassie for giving us a peek into your life.  *

*Love,*

*Dona & Beth*
