Here at Fibonacci Sequins, we're all about recycling. After all, we're Seattle-ites (sometimes). We have to pass the recycle test before we're allowed to live here! (That's not true, but it might as well be). We'll come back to recycling in a minute.

For Dona, every day is Valentine's Day.[![](http://www.fibonaccisequinsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_8285-683x1024.jpg)](http://www.fibonaccisequinsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_8285.jpg)

Indulging in wine and chocolates? Daily sustenance! (What are we, barbarians?)

Wearing red on the regular? It's a neutral!

Expressing her affection for the ones she loves?  Yes, every day!

Since every day is Valentine's Day, why relegate wearing a good Valentine's Day outfit just once a year?  Fashion is one of the [biggest industries to cause waste in the world](http://www.divinecaroline.com/life-etc/culture-causes/ready-waste-ugly-side-fast-fashion) and we're big fans of finding multiple ways to wear our fanciest and most casual pieces.   This red beaded vintage 20s flapper dress is no exception: perfect for both day AND night!

What? There's no way you can wear a red, beaded flapper thing for work, you say? WRONG, we say!

How about with a boyfriend blazer (to exhibit some law & order in meetings), fingerless fuzzy gloves (to keep your fingers warm in the subzero office temperatures) and a scarf? So pro.

Dress is vintage from Pretty Parlour in Seattle. Something similar is [here](http://amzn.to/1Px3inT). The [jacket](http://amzn.to/1VdZGbS) is by Theory and the [scarf](http://amzn.to/243Cl2H) is a find from one of the thousand plaid shops in Edinburgh.  The boots are the trusty Stuart Weitzman Highlands which Dona literally lives in (an almost duplicate one that all of our blogger friends love are [these](http://amzn.to/1VdZZDK))  and the [fingerless gloves](http://amzn.to/1VdZTf8) are handmade in Seattle. [![](http://www.fibonaccisequinsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_8306-1024x683.jpg)](http://www.fibonaccisequinsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_8306.jpg)

For an evening event, date night, girls night or just brunch, the white cape is the perfect topper during this chilly season. This specific one was was negotiated in a vintage shop in Paris many years ago but [this one](http://amzn.to/1Ve0uxs) is quite awesome too. Dona is pretty proud she not only haggled *en francais* but also got a price 1/4 of what was quoted. Vintage AND haggling? *Oh mon dieu!*

If there's anything Dona loves *almost* as much as her people, it's haggling a great deal.

And Beth? How does she feel about Valentine's Day?

*Ah...Valentine's Day. What better day for [flower crowns](http://amzn.to/1Px4Uhs) than valentines day? Consider taking a break from indulging your inner ironic hipster and find a suitably [revealing dress](http://amzn.to/1SOCrb7) to pair with it.*

*Haha just kidding. This Valentines Day, show your distaste for american capitalism/consumer greed by going the full IDGAF.* (PSA: Dona did not approve of Beth climbing up into this sketch fire escape thing)
