*Jasmine is the living embodiment of a multi-hyphenate. She's passionate, hard-working and good at putting a positive spin on things whilst also not taking no for an answer. And with all the cool projects she's got going on, she definitely knows how to dress for the different roles she plays in different spheres.*

### Tell us a little about you.

I'm a multi-passionate maker who loves to travel and learn. I currently serve as a Program Manager on the HoloLens team at Microsoft and as the Founder & Chief Experience Officer at [EDEN BodyWorks](http://edenbodyworks.com/).

My undergraduate degree is in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology and I am working to complete a Master’s in Human Centered Design and Engineering at the University of Washington.

### Tell us about what you're wearing.

Today you’ll see 3 looks that I’ve named CEO, Sweetheart and Techie.

My CEO look is mature, sexy and professional; As an entrepreneur I am often meeting with new people around the world and negotiating deals to drive my company forward.

My Sweetheart look can be described as cute, colorful and feminine; This look captures my high energy and fun approach to life.

Finally, my Techie look is a casual, comfy and chill style that you can catch me in most days of the week; It compliments my laid back work environment where we’re more focused on what you do rather than how you look while doing it.

### How did your style evolve to what it is now?

My style grew as my careers developed and changed. There are definitely ‘uniforms’ in different industries but I like to put my own twist on them to make them personal. The clothes and accessories I wear match not just my situation but my mood and outlook for the day.

### Do you have any style icons or favorite brands?

Two of my favorite brands are [Merona](http://www.target.com/bp/merona) and [Converse](http://www.converse.com/us/en_us/c/converse).

### Any advice for a young person thinking about getting into a STEM field?

STEM is a huge field with many different ways to make impact. For a young person looking to get into STEM, I would challenge them to explore different roles and industries through internships and interviews with people who are at different stages in their careers. The more exposure to the possibilities that are out there, the more likely they are to find something that is a perfect fit for them.

### What would you say is the project you've done that you're proudest of?

The project I am the most proud of is [Clubs on Xbox Live](http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/xbox-live/clubs-info). This feature allowed gamers across many different gaming platforms to create their own communities to play, connect and share with other gamers around the world. The feedback for this feature so far has been very positive and I believe that this feature is doing a lot to increase social connections and fun on Xbox.

### Are there any misconceptions about STEM fields that you'd like to clear up?

Yes! A PM needs more than just good communication and leadership skills. Technical, business and/or design skills are very important if you want to be a dynamic PM. At their core a PM is not just an amazing communicator but also a continuous learner. If you are able to learn to speak the languages of your teammates fields you can do a lot more to help them work effectively together.

### Anything else you'd like to share with the audience?

[![](http://www.fibonaccisequinsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_3028-683x1024.jpg)](http://www.fibonaccisequinsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_3028-683x1024.jpg)

To close I want to share how important it is to surround yourself with people who will encourage, challenge and inspire you. Good friends as well as experienced mentors are great assets for a thriving career (and in life in general).

### What is the best way (if any) for people to follow you on social media?
