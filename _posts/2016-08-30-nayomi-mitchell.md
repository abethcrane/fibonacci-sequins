*We had such a darling time shooting Nayomi as a Microsoft intern, and we're stoked to feature her on the blog now as our way of saying welcome back! Her outfit is the definition of timeless-chic-with-a-pop-of-color, and we love everything about it.*

### Tell us a little about you.

I'm a recent graduate from the Georgia Institute of Technology. I didn't study Computer Science, but rather a combination of computer science, design, and psychology all rolled up into one major called Computational Media - I'm very passionate about programming things that look nice and have good usability.

Outside of class and work, you can catch me singing and playing either the ukulele or the harp. You can also find me playing Xbox or PC games. Right now, I work at Microsoft as a Software Engineer.

### Tell us about what you're wearing.

This is one of my more quirkier and fun outfits! I'm wearing my polka dot dress with pink tights, black flats, and a navy cardigan. To top it all off, I'm wearing my brown watch and black purse.

The dress is from H&M, which I shop at frequently. I found the cardigan and flats while thrift shopping, the watch is from Fossil, and the purse was from my mom's closet.

As you can see, I get my wardrobe pieces from everywhere - you tend to find the best things in the strangest places.

### How did your style evolve to what it is now?

My style started out as an amalgamation of my parents' fashion sense and popular wardrobe staples. My parents, who lived through so many great decades, influenced my music tastes and also my fashion sense. I'm a big fan of things like bright 80's patterns but also simple pieces like chambray shirts and A-line dresses.

Over time, my style has gotten more refined. I started thinking more about fit and body shape and began to buy wardrobe pieces that looked good and felt good to wear. I try to have staples that can be accessorized to create exciting outfits, rather than having a lot of over-embellished items in my wardrobe. I really wanted to make getting up in the morning and finding something to wear as efficient as possible! When mostly everything matches, I can practically grab anything out of my closet and look polished.

### Any advice for a young person thinking about getting into a STEM field?

Find mentors! It's definitely one of the best things to do. It's really beneficial to have a mentor who can provide experience and encouragement. *(Look to your lecturers, your coworkers on internships, older students in your degree, family friends, or get twitter stalking!).*

**What would you say is the project you've done that you're proudest of?[ ](https://fibonaccisequinsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_5650.jpg)[![](https://fibonaccisequinsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_5699-683x1024.jpg)](https://fibonaccisequinsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_5699.jpg)**

In my final semester of college, for senior design, my group and I made a 3D dragon-fighting video game that used the Leap Motion and the Oculus Rift. The idea was that people undergoing occupational hand therapy could play the game, which forces them to make gripping motions to find ingredients, make potions, and throw those potions at dragons. It was incredibly fun to make and we ended up producing a really cool demo of our game.

### Are there any misconceptions about STEM fields that you'd like to clear up?

I feel like a lot of people think that working in the tech field means that everyone sits at their computer and code endlessly through the work day. There's a lot of collaboration that comes with programming, whether it's building something with others or code reviews. I get up regularly to ask questions and work with my peers. Being a developer is a lot more social than people might think.

### Anything else you'd like to share with the audience?

It's really random, but a couple of months ago, I wanted to keep track of my wardrobe. I decided to make a spreadsheet where I listed every clothing I have. I like being really, really organized!

### What is the best way (if any) for people to follow you on social media?

I would say [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nayomitchell/) (@nayomitchell)! I post there very regularly.

*How do you improve upon building something in 3D with dragons? You make it useful for occupational therapy! It's so inspiring to us to consistently see the wonderful people we feature on here using tech to improve the world. Do reach out to Nayomi on instagram if you want to hear more about it :)*

*Much love,*

*Dona & Beth*
