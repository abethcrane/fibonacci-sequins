Hello friends!

When we promote diversity in [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM_fields) fields, we ask questions like, “what made you get into this field” and “what are your thoughts on diversity within the industry“, but we never touch upon the beautiful and unique personal style that people bring with them into these fields.

So let’s change that: Fibonacci Sequins is a style blog that showcases and celebrates diversity + personal style in STEM. By sharing who we are, we will not only celebrate each other’s individuality, but also show the future STEM-stars that there isn’t one kind of role model – there are literally hundreds, and no one has to change who they are to fit in.

This blog started back in 2015 by [Dona Sarkar](http://donasarkar.com) and [Beth Crane](http://bethcrane.com), planned out in late nights at our beloved Cafe Solstice. It’s kept up by Beth while Dona gallivants around the world charming developers, creating entrepreneurs and challenging the status quo (all in her innovative and socially-responsible fashion-line!)

We’ve seen a wonderful mix of street-style, eco-friendly thrifting gems, work aesthetics, vintage scores, designer pieces, tricked-out career fair t-shirts, traffic-stopping accessories and everything in between. Meeting amazing people from around the world and profiling them on the blog is a constant source of joy and inspiration.

It’s time for us to be proud of who we are and embrace that we can be geeks gone chic!

If you or someone you know want to be featured on Fibonacci Sequins, please contact us and we’ll figure out a way to make it happen!

Love,

Beth (and the ghost of Dona’s free time)
